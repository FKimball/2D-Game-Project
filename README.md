2D Game Project 
By: Saif, Frankie, Mila, and Anton

LATEST: Beginning of the Game\
Anton: Updated the coin drop minigame, still uses placeholders but almost functional. Need to fix a bug with position reseting.

OLD:
Anton: Made an outline for the last level (using rectangles and the default robot sprite). So far, the player can walk up to a workbench which will enter a "coin dropper" mini-game for them to make the gold pouches to distribute to the villagers afterwards.

Lab #2: collaborate to create multiple scenes
